# Video-Based Barbell Velocity Tracking Senior Comps

This repository holds all necessary LateX files to compile and view my Senior Comprehensive project paper.
All files can be downloaded and compiled via a LateX compiler or simply view the .pdf in this repo.

To view and/or run the actual app, please go to [Raise The Bar](https://github.com/NeythonLecStreitz/BarbellTrackingCode).
